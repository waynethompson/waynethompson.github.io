## About Me
Hello and welcome to my blog! I'm Wayne Thompson, a tech enthusiast with a deep passion for creating algorithms to solve problems.
I'm also a scuba diver, scout leader, SES member, and have a penchant for electronic music and synthesizers.

## My Journey
I've been coding since the late 80s, though my professional carreer began in about 2000.

My journey with BenchOn began in December 2017, where I took on the role of a tech co-founder. My mission was to evolve the company from its initial Minimum Viable Product (MVP) stage to a fully-fledged, scalable product ready for the international market. As the Chief Technology Officer since January 2020, I've been pivotal in aligning our technical strategies with business goals and customer needs, translating them into actionable and innovative product roadmaps.

My responsibilities have spanned across various domains, from managing and collaborating with cross-functional teams to conducting market research, prioritizing features, and ensuring our products meet and exceed market demands. I'm deeply involved in every stage of product development, from conceptualization to deployment, and constantly seek feedback for iterative improvements.

## My Passion
I am particularly passionate about tackling algorithmic challenges and finding innovative solutions to complex workflows. This has led me to not only improve our products but also to connect with other professionals who share similar interests and face comparable challenges in this niche.

## Education & Skills
My educational background includes a Master of Business Administration (Computing) from Charles Sturt University, focusing on Information Technology Project Management, and a Graduate Certificate of Data Science from the University of New England, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. My skill set is diverse, encompassing strategy, communication, knowledge sharing, software quality, and much more.

## Let's Connect
I strongly believe in the power of collaboration and knowledge sharing to drive advancements in HR technology. If you're involved in HR tech and are working on exciting algorithmic problems, I would be thrilled to connect with you. Let's exchange insights, experiences, and ideas to shape the future of HR technology together.

Thank you for visiting my blog. I hope you find the content insightful and engaging. Let's embark on this journey of technological exploration and innovation together!
